# Generic-classes

<h2>Description</h2>
<b>Define a generic class on example of a linked list and how to use it to store different types of data.</b> </br></br>
<p>
The application is designed to store four different types of data at
using collections belonging to one generic class. The generic class implements
dynamic data structure in the form of a bidirectional linked list.
Each item stored in the collection will be accessed using
index (number of item in the list) and Id, which will be a unique value of any
numeric type (it can be e.g. Byte, Short, Integer, Double, etc.).
